              <h2>RoBERTa-Powered Twitter Sentiment Analysis on Threads App</h2><br>
              <p>My expertise includes using sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods for the purpose of conducting sentiment analysis, with a particular emphasis on the RoBERTa model. The findings of my paper reveal that cutting-edge natural language processing methods are successful in identifying subtleties of sentiment inside Twitter datasets.
                 I was able to improve the accuracy and granularity of the sentiment classification by applying painstaking preparation techniques, such as tokenization, the elimination of stopwords, and data cleaning. In addition, I carried out Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in order to get a better understanding of the properties of the dataset. 
                Through the use of RoBERTa and several other natural language processing tools, I was able to improve feature sets and optimise the performance of sentiment analysis. This highlighted the significance of preprocessing processes and model selection in the process of generating accurate findings. The purpose of this project is to provide a contribution to a more thorough knowledge of sentiment analysis on social media platforms, 
                with the intention of expanding its applications to include social analytics and opinion mining. Skills such as natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, RoBERTa, data preparation, and electronic data analysis (EDA) are essential.</p>

                <h2>Alzheimer Dementia Classification and Detection</h2><br>
                <p>In my Machine Learning project, I did Alzheimer's Dementia Classification. Labeled brain images undergo preprocessing, featuring normalization and resizing. Employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture enhances image recognition. Hyperparameter tuning optimizes learning rates for performance. The dataset is split for training and testing, preventing overfitting. Model evaluation includes metrics like Accuracy, Precision, and Recall. Post-training, the model is deployed on Streamlit for scalability, enabling it to analyze new images and provide diagnostic outcomes. This streamlined process also facilitates data collection, amplifying the project's impact.</p>
